			<h1>2D Tile Game Planning<div class="timestamp">2016-01-20</div></h1>
			<p>
				I'm bored, so I'll do what I always seem do when I'm bored: attempt to clone something.
				As with all my clones, they don't try to be a straight copy of whatever they're a clone of.
				So what am I cloning this time? Terraria / Starbound.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's been long enough since I last touched my <a href="https://github.com/minuskelvin/Miner/">Miner</a> project that I think I should start from scratch again.
				I can't even remember where in development that project was.
				So I decided that this time I would plan out what features I want my game to have first, and then start working on it afterwards.
				I've heard a lot about planning things too detailed too far ahead can lead to catastrophic failure, so I'll just make a general outline.
			</p>
			<h2>Features</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Subtile collision</li>
				<li>Dynamic lighting with shadows</li>
				<li>Infinite world</li>
				<li>Biomes</li>
				<li>Caves</li>
				<li>Ores</li>
				<li>Technology tree</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				I feel that that might be somewhat ambitious, but mostly because of the later content-based features.
				I listed the more technically-challenging features first, since they are more interesting and were the first I came up with.
				So now I'm going to discuss possible implementations for these, to hopefully know about what I need to do to get these working.
			</p>
			<h2>Subtile Collision</h2>
			<p>
				I've only ever implemented solid-tile based collision before, but subtile collision should be a relatively simple extension to that.
			</p>
			<p>
				The simplest case for subtile collision would be changing the location of the side of the tile.
				Normal tiles have the left and right sides at 0 and 1 respectively.
				Another tile, such as a fence, would have its left and right sides be at 0.25 and 0.75 respectively, making it only half a tile wide.
				Then the same for the bottom and top sides, which are normally at 0 and 1 respectively.
				Something like a half-slab would have its bottom and top sides be at 0 and 0.5 respectively.
			</p>
			<p>
				Things get a bit more complicated when we try and do more complex shapes.
				Stairs, at least ones similar to what is in Minecraft, can't be done by simply giving them side locations.
				Stairs would have its top side be at 0.5 on the left half of the tile and 1 on the right half.
				Same with the left side, 0 on the bottom half and 0.5 on the top half.
				This can probably be handled by special functions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Last special case: slanted slopes.
				These things are a pain.
				The special functions to handle these are going to start to get pretty complicated rather quickly.
				The main issue with these is that you are able to travel up and down them.
				The complexity of this should be apparent, since there are a LOT of variables involved.
			</p>
			<h2>Dynamic Lighting with Shadows</h2>
			<p>
				The &quot;with shadows&quot; is the difficult part here.
				I can't use a flood-fill algorithm because it doesn't have shadows, so I need something quite a bit more complex.
				I have come up with a list of possible implementations for these, but none of them seem perfect.
			</p>
			<p>
				My first implementation: My own hand-designed system.
				This involves storing a bunch of data per-block-corner, and sometimes per-block-side data.
				It basically goes each corner has 2 values: a direction and if it's lit or not.
				The values for each corner are calculated per-block with a whole ton of math.
				The advantage is that as a tile system it plays nicely with all the other tile systems.
				The limitations are that light can't go through tiles, it doesn't support moving lights well,
				it cannot be used for sunlight, and the shadows are not at screen-resolution and will look jagged.
			</p>
			<p>
				Second implementation: Generating light polygons
				This involves calculating a bunch of polygons that form the area that is visible from the light.
				The math involved is relatively complicated.
				The advantages are that shadows are screen-resolution and light can go through tiles however much I want.
				The limitations are that it cannot be used for sunlight, it doesn't play nice with the other tile systems, and it doesn't support moving lights well.
			</p>
			<p>
				Last implementation: Shadow maps
				This could be done by rendering the world then transforming it to polar space, or using &quot;square map&quot; textures.
				The idea is a shadow map is generated from the world geometry, and then at final rendering it's used to draw the shadows.
				The advantages are that shadows are near screen-resolution, light can go through tiles however much I want,
				it can be used from sunlight, and it should be able to support moving lights.
				The limitations are that it is hard to implement and it doesn't play nice with the other tile systems.
			</p>
			<h2>Infinite World</h2>
			<p>
				The Java garbage collector doesn't like me having large amounts of memory being used, so I need to only store in memory what I need.
				The easiest way to do that would be the have a chunking system.
				The chunking system might be able to simplify certain aspects of terrain generation as well.
				I don't have more to say about this.
			</p>
			<h2>The rest of them</h2>
			<p>
				These currently have few enough details that they can be summed up in about a line, so here we go.
				Biomes are tricky mostly because of transitions between them. Kindof hard to go from Mountains to Ocean.
				Caves are probably able to be generated with 2D OpenSimplex noise.
				Ores will probably include Copper, Tin, Iron, Lead, Silver, Gold, Diamond, Ruby, Emerald, and Sapphire.
				The technology tree with be planned out later.
			</p>
			<p>
				That's probably enough planning for now, hopefully.
