                What is OpenGL
            </h1>
            <p>
                OpenGL is a library that lets you do hardware acclerated
                graphics. It is an open standard and is cross-platform, meaning
                applications that use it can easily be ported with zero, if not
                few, changes to their graphics systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                There have been many versions of OpenGL, from 1.0 to 4.5 (as of
                the time of writing). The version of OpenGL this tutorial will
                be covering is OpenGL 3.3, since it is the most recent version
                widely supported by graphics card drivers and is Core profile.
                After you have created your OpenGL 3.3 Core Profile context, you
                can start to use OpenGL.
            </p>
            <p>
                OpenGL works by taking a bunch of vertices, creating triangles
                from them, and then turning those triangles into pixels on the
                screen. A vertex, in simple terms, is a point that contains
                information, called attributes, such as color, texture
                corrdinates, position, and so on. OpenGL uses these values to
                produce each pixel's color. This is an overly-simplified
                explanation, but should help you get an idea of how OpenGL
                works.

            </h2>
            <p>
                The first thing you need to do is create a Vertex Array Object,
                or VAO for short. I think these are poorly named, because these
                do not actually store vertices. I'll get into VAOs more later,
                but just need know you need one of these to render anything.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here we have a new type and two functions. <code>GLuint</code>
                is simply a 32-bit unsigned integer. We declare it with
                <code>GLuint</code> because different platforms could make
                <code>unsigned int</code>s different sizes and OpenGL needs a
                32-bit unsigned integer.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>glGenVertexArrays</code> generates bindings for VAOs. The
                first parameter is the number of VAOs you want to generate, and
                the second parameter is a pointer to an array of
                <code>GLuint</code>s that OpenGL will store the bindings in.
                Since we're only generating one VAO, we create a single integer
                and pass a pointer to it. <code>glBindVertexArray</code> tells
                OpenGL which VAO to use, in this case the one we just made.

            </h2>
            <p>
                The next thing we need to do is give OpenGL the vertex data we
                want it to render. For this we use Vertex Buffer Objects, or
                VBOs for short. A VBO is a block of memory that is allocated on
                the graphics processor.

            <p>
                We'll be drawing a triangle that stretches across the
                bottom-left corner and bottom-right corner and up to the
                top-middle of our window. This is reflected in our
                <code>triangle</code> array (which we declare with
                <code>GLfloat</code> to ensure a 32-bit float). You might notice
                that these are not screen coordinates, and this tutorial will
                touch on that later. Our vertices from this triangle consist of
                just one attribute, a position, which we have represented as 3
                floats. The positions of the vertices are the only requirement
                for rendering anything.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>glGenBuffers</code> looks very similar to
                <code>glGenVertexArrays</code>, and it is&mdash;the only thing
                that's changed is what type of object we're generating.
                In <code>glBindBuffer</code> we need to specify what target we
                want to bind our vbo to. We want to store vertex data in it, so
                we'll go with <code>GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> which can be used as
                inputs for vertex data. Different targets do different things,
                so this value will change with what we want the buffer to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                On that last line we call <code>glBufferData</code>, and that
                does two things: Firstly it allocates (or reallocates, if you've
                already allocated space for the buffer)
                <code>sizeof(triangle)</code> bytes of storage (specified by the
                second parameter) for the buffer bound to
                <code>GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> (specified by the first parameter).
                Secondly it copies the data at whatever pointer we've passed it
                into the buffer. Alternatively we could pass a null pointer to
                tell OpenGL not to copy anything. The last parameter is a hint
                that tells OpenGL how to expect we use the buffer. We use
                <code>GL_STATIC_DRAW</code> because we'll be drawing with the
                buffer and we won't be updating its contents very much. This
                hint doesn't restrict what you can do with the buffer, it may
                just help OpenGL use it more efficently.

                Telling OpenGL About the Vertex Data
            </h2>
            <p>
                At this point, we have a buffer containing the information we
                need to draw a triangle. But we haven't told OpenGL that the
                data exists, what type it is, where it should go, or how it's
                structured.

<span class="code-func">glEnableVertexAttribArray</span>(<span class="code-literal">0</span>);
</pre>
            <p>
                The handy function <code>glVertexAttribPointer</code> tells
                OpenGL everything it needs to know about an attribute. We have
                one attribute that is made of three (second parameter) floats
                (third parameter) that shouldn't be normalized (fourth
                parameter). We also tell OpenGL that the data is tightly packed
                (fifth parameter) and starts at the beginning of the buffer
                currently bound to the <code>GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> target. The
                first parameter tells OpenGL that this attribute will get sent
                to index zero in the vertex shader. We'll talk about shaders
                later in this tutorial.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second function, <code>glEnableVertexAttribArray</code>,
                tells OpenGL that we're using the attribute for index 0. If you
                need to disable a vertex attribute, you can do so with
                <code>glDisableVertexAttribArray</code>.
            </p>
            <h3>A note on VAOs</h3>
            <p>
                <code>glVertexAttribPointer</code> and
                <code>glEnableVertexAttribArray</code> both affect whatever VAO
                is currently bound. The buffer that was bound to
                <code>GL_ARRAY_BUFFER</code> when
                <code>glVertexAttribPointer</code> was called is stored by the
                VAO, aswell as the index of the attribute, the number of
                components of what type of data is stored, if that data should
                be normalized, its stride or if its tightly packed, and its
                offset into the buffer. This means that you can preform these
                function with different VAOs bound and switch which set of
                attribute information you want to use by just calling
                <code>glBindVertexArray</code>.

                Shaders
            </h2>
			<p>
				OpenGL doesn't actually know what any of the attributes you tell
				it about do. You have to write some code for the graphics
				processor in order to specify that. There are two shaders we
				need to write: a vertex shader and a fragment shader. The vertex
				shader runs on every vertex OpenGL processes, and the fragment
				shader runs on every pixel OpenGL processes.
			</p>
			<h3>Vertex Shader</h3>
			<pre>
<span class="code-comment">// GLSL, Vertex Shader</span>
<span class="code-keyword">#version</span> 330 core

<span class="code-keyword">layout</span>(<span class="code-var">location</span> = <span class="code-literal">0</span>) <span class="code-keyword">in</span> <span class="code-type">vec3</span> <span class="code-var">position</span>;

<span class="code-keyword">void</span> <span class="code-func">main</span>() {
    <span class="code-var">gl_Position</span> = <span class="code-type">vec4</span>(<span class="code-var">position</span>, <span class="code-literal">1.0</span>);
}
</pre>
			<p>
				The first thing we do in the shader, and all of our shaders
				actually, is specify the version of GLSL we're using. The GLSL
				version that goes with OpenGL 3.3 Core profile is <code>330
				core</code>. This must come become before anything else in the
				shader except for whitespace and comments. Next we say that we
				have a <code>vec3</code> input, or an input made of three
				floats, and it's <code>layout</code> qualifier says that it
				should be at index 0, the same place we said our position
				attribute should go. We give the input the name
				<code>position</code>, because that makes it easy for us to see
				what it's for.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next we have the <code>main</code> function, and this is where
				our shaders starts executing. We only need to tell OpenGL what
				the position of our vertex is, so we set it to a
				<code>vec4</code> with it's first 3 components, the x, y, and z
				axes the same as in our <code>position</code> attribute, and its
				w component equal to 1. This might seem really strange, a four
				component position vector? We're not working in 4D space!
				Actually we are working in 3D space, but not with standard
				cartesian (x,y,z) coordinates. We're using homogeneous (x,y,z,w)
				coordinates, which include a special w component. I'll explain
				what this does and why it's important for how computer graphics
				work later in this tutorial.
			</p>
			<h3>Fragment Shader</h3>
			<pre>
<span class="code-comment">// GLSL, Fragment Shader</span>
<span class="code-keyword">#version</span> 330 core

<span class="code-keyword">out</span> <span class="code-type">vec4</span> <span class="code-var">color</span>;

<span class="code-keyword">void</span> <span class="code-func">main</span>() {
    <span class="code-var">color</span> = <span class="code-type">vec4</span>(<span class="code-literal">1.0</span>);
}
</pre>
			<p>
				In the fragment shader, instead of specifying and input, we
				specify an output. OpenGL automatically interperts this output
				as a color, but not because of it's name. We could have named it
				anything and OpenGL would still interpert it the same. Our
				output is a four component vector, for the red, blue, green, and
				alpha channels. The alpha channel doesn't affect the final
				color unless you tell OpenGL to do something with it. In our
				<code>main</code> function, we set our color output to a
				<code>vec4</code> with all of it's components equal to 1. In
				OpenGL, colors range from 0 to 1, unlike what you might be used
				to in things like image editing programs where colors range from
				0-255. 0 is no color, 1 is full color, 0.5 is half color, etc.
				By setting the color to all ones, we can expect that our final
				triangle will be all white.
			</p>
			<h3>Compiling and Using the Shaders</h3>
			<p>
				Now that we have our shaders, we need to give OpenGL them so
				that they can be compiled and used. I'll asume that you can get
				the shaders into strings yourself for simplicity's sake.

			<p>
				This code does creates two shaders, a vertex shader and a
				fragment shader. We use <code>glShaderSource</code> to upload
				our shaders' source code to OpenGL. The
				<code>stringsInArrayFor*</code> variables are integers that
				tell OpenGL the length of the string arrays. This can be 1 if
				you are passing OpenGL a pointer to a single string. The
				<code>arrayOfStringsFor*</code> variables are arrays of strings
				containing each shader's source code. Note these are arrays of
				strings, so it takes a <code>GLchar**</code>. The final paramter
				tells OpenGL that each string is null-terminated.
				<code>glCompileShader</code> is self-explanitory, and we will
				cover how to get information on if the shaders compiled
				successfully and if they didn't why they didn't later.
			</p>

				We have our shader objects now, so next we need to link them

				data has been copied to the shader program, so they're just
