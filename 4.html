			<h1>The Economics of Patronage<div class="timestamp">2016-11-24</div></h1>
			<p>
				I'm pretty sure "patronage" is the word I'm looking for.
				I can't be sure, though, since a Google search for "economics of patronage" gave results about societal structures and political economics,
				neither of which are related to what I want to discuss here.
				I want to discuss why a business model I have seen appearing recently is economically viable.
			</p>
			<p>
				The pure version of the business model operates like this: A business produces a product, such as a YouTube video, with a marginal cost of zero.
				The business, since the supply of this product is infinite, gives it away for free and provides a way for patrons to donate to the business,
				through a service such as Patreon. These donations are the only form of revenue that the business earns.
			</p>
			<p>
				For now, we will consider the patrons to actually be a single patron, because for now it will be easier to think of it that way.
				The patron is buying something from the business, but what are they buying?
				They are not buying the products the business produces, since those are given away to everyone, even people that aren't the patron, for free.
				They are instead buying the production of the products, since the product would not be produced without the patron's donation.
				I have decided to call the product of the production of a zero marginal cost product a contract.
			</p>
			<p>
				A contract, being abstracted a level above a product, has a marginal cost equal to the fixed cost of the product the contract says should be produced.
				The business model works by effectively selling these contracts instead of typical products.
				These contracts are entirely abstract and so the patron does not actually receive anything deliverable in the transaction,
				which is why I refer to the transactions as donations.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the case of a single or few patrons, they have a clear reason to donate to the business, since the products will not be produced without their donations.
				It gets more complicated in the case that has allowed this business model to become viable for small businesses, where there are many patrons each contributing a small amount.
				With many patrons, the motivation of each patron to donate to the business is not as clear.
